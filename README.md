### About This Project
  
This system automatically:
1. downloads geomagnetic field data from [INTERMAGNET](https://www.intermagnet.org/data-donnee/download-eng.php) stations,
2. processes the nighttime data (20:00–04:00 LT) to calculate the Polarization Ratio (PRA),
3. identifies anomalies based on dynamically updated thresholding, and
4. updates the detection results and figures into this repository automatically.
  
Nighttime window analysis is performed daily around 03:00 AM Japan Standard Time (UTC+9).
